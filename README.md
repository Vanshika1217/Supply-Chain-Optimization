# Supply-Chain-Optimization
This repository contains a project titled Supply Chain Optimization, which aims to enhance the efficiency of supply chain management through the application of advanced algorithms. The project includes components such as supplier path determination, inventory scheduling, and data compression.
Detailed Description:
The project employs Dijkstra's algorithm for optimal supplier path determination to reduce transportation costs and improve delivery efficiency. For maximizing daily profits through inventory optimization, it uses a combination of greedy algorithms for handling time-sensitive orders and the 0/1 knapsack algorithm for effective resource allocation, aiming to optimize production schedules and resource utilization. To manage the large volumes of data inherent in supply chain operations more effectively, Huffman encoding is implemented for data compression. Additionally, Huffman decoding techniques are developed to ensure data accessibility and accurate interpretation for decision-making processes.
